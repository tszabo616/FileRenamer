# File Renamer

This application allows the user to rename files in batch. The user interface gives the user options to:
  1) Change the order of the selected files
  2) Add/remove/modify prefixes of all file names. This includes adding a forming of numbering to the start of each file name (letters, numbers or Roman numeral)
  4) Add/remove/modify suffixes of all file names. This includes adding a forming of numbering to the end of each file name (letters, numbers or Roman numeral)

For the modification of prefixes and suffixes, the user can take advantage of regular expressions.
